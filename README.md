# Horse Image Segmentation (PyTorch CNN)

This project is an individual ML project for image segmentation of horses using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in PyTorch.

## 📝 Problem
Segment horse images from the background to produce masks for downstream tasks such as object detection or analysis.

## 🛠 Approach
- Encoder–decoder CNN using Conv2d, MaxPool2d, ConvTranspose2d layers
- Trained on 328 horse images resized to 32×32
- Binary mask segmentation (0 = background, 1 = horse)
- Used Intersection-over-Union (IoU) as evaluation metric
- Achieved **70%+ IoU** on test set

## 📊 Results
- Sample predictions are in `notebooks/horse_segmentation_demo.ipynb`
- Model weights saved as `models/best_model.pth`
